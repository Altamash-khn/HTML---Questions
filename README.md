# HTML Questions Repository

Welcome to the **HTML---Questions** repository!  
This project is designed for anyone who wants to **practice HTML by solving real questions**.

##  Repository Structure

Each question has **its own folder**.  
Inside every folder, you will find:

### 1. `question.txt`
Contains the problem or prompt you need to solve.

### 2. `.html` file  
This file contains the **solution** to the question.  
You can attempt the question yourself before checking the answer.
